cat("It is generally understood that within the next 30 years a majority of the U.S. population will belong to a minority group. Inspired by this growth statistic, we wanted to further explore the interesting role of minority groups in the U.S. from an economic perspective. Essentially, our project helps us delve into the nature of the economic growth of minority groups in the U.S over a set time period. This project analyzes various trends such as income and expenditure levels for minority groups to develop a larger understanding of economic trends that we defined as ‘purchasing power.’ This project examines purchasing power through the total spending on essential and nonessential items. Some examples of essential items we chose are Food, Healthcare, and Apparel. Examples of nonessential items are Alcohol and Entertainment. We visualized how spending on these items changed over the years by each race. In addition our project analyzes trends in homeownership rates over the last 20 years. A cornerstone of fiscal independence, the proportion of minority groups which do own homes is another perspective to understanding the purchasing power of minorities in the U.S.
-How has income after taxes changed by race (specifically White, Hispanic, NonHispanic, and Black) from 1994-2004?
-How has expenditure changed by race (specifically White, Hispanic, NonHispanic, and Black) from 1994-2004?
-How has homeownership rates changed by race (Hispanic, Black Alone, NonHispanic, White Alone, and Other) from 1994-2004?
-How has essential spending changed by race (specifically White, Hispanic, NonHispanic, and Black) from 1994-2004?
-How has nonessential spending changed by race(specifically White, Hispanic, NonHispanic, and Black) from 1994-2004?

Special Instructions:
For the data set that we used to analyze income, expenditure, non essential spending and essential spending, we only used years 1994-2002. We had to start with 1994 because previous years were in PDF format. We intended to end with 2004 (later years were in XLS), but starting in 2003 BLS’s race data accounted only for White / Black / Asian / Other and Hispanic data was placed in separate data files with unique formatting. Therefore we decided to exclude these years and solely focus on the years with a consistent file and formatting type: 1994-2002.
The data set that we used to analyze homeownership rates was only provided in xls format. Since the project instructions specified that we shouldn’t use xls format, we manually saved that data set in csv format.
Directory-File Structure:
Our project is split into 5 directories: code, rawdata, data, report, and images. In the code directory, we have the functions that we used to analyze the data. We also have functions that created vectors for the graphs. In the raw data directory we have our data sets from the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our data directory contains the cleaned data sets. In the reports directory, we have our project report that contains the complete analysis of the graphs and the trends. Our images directory contains our graphs.

Essentially, our project helps us delve into the nature of the economic growth of minority groups in the U.S over a set time period. This project analyzes various trends such as income and expenditure levels for minority groups to develop a larger understanding of economic trends that we defined as ‘purchasing power.’ This project examines purchasing power through the total spending on essential and nonessential items. Some examples of essential items we chose are Food, Healthcare, and Apparel. Examples of nonessential items are Alcohol and Entertainment. We visualized how spending on these items changed over the years by each race. In addition our project analyzes trends in homeownership rates over the last 20 years. A cornerstone of fiscal independence, the proportion of minority groups which do own homes is another perspective to understanding the purchasing power of minorities in the U.S.
-How has income after taxes changed by race (specifically White, Hispanic, NonHispanic, and Black) from 1994-2004?
-How has expenditure changed by race (specifically White, Hispanic, NonHispanic, and Black) from 1994-2004?
-How has homeownership rates changed by race (Hispanic, Black Alone, NonHispanic, White Alone, and Other) from 1994-2004?
-How has essential spending changed by race (specifically White, Hispanic, NonHispanic, and Black) from 1994-2004?
-How has nonessential spending changed by race(specifically White, Hispanic, NonHispanic, and Black) from 1994-2004?

Special Instructions:
For the data set that we used to analyze income, expenditure, non essential spending and essential spending, we only used years 1994-2002. We had to start with 1994 because previous years were in PDF format. We intended to end with 2004 (later years were in XLS), but starting in 2003 BLS’s race data accounted only for White / Black / Asian / Other and Hispanic data was placed in separate data files with unique formatting. Therefore we decided to exclude these years and solely focus on the years with a consistent file and formatting type: 1994-2002.
The data set that we used to analyze homeownership rates was only provided in xls format. Since the project instructions specified that we shouldn’t use xls format, we manually saved that data set in csv format.
Directory-File Structure:
Our project is split into 5 directories: code, rawdata, data, report, and images. In the code directory, we have the functions that we used to analyze the data. We also have functions that created vectors for the graphs. In the raw data directory we have our data sets from the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our data directory contains the cleaned data sets. In the reports directory, we have our project report that contains the complete analysis of the graphs and the trends. Our images directory contains our graphs.
